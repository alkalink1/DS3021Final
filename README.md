## Predicting Obesity
#### Alka Link, Grace Pitts, Michael Carlson

This is the repo for the Machine Learning Foundations Final Group Project: Predicting Obesity

Question:
Is it possible to predict obesity using contextual health factors rather than relying on BMI?

We are asking this question because BMI can be a misleading measure of health. By exploring whether contextual health factors (like family history, food intake, physical activity levels, etc.) can better predict obesity, we have the ability to move toward more personalized and accurate health assessments. This could help individuals along with doctors in reducing misclassification of obesity and can lead to better health outcomes.
