Question:
Is it possible to predict obesity using contextual health factors rather than relying on BMI?


Research:

Although BMI (calculated by using height and weight) can be a helpful measure for obesity, it does have limits. BMI cannot differentiate between body fat and muscle mass, therefore BMI may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build, and may also underestimate body fat in older persons and others who have lost muscle. There may be other indicators that are more accurate than BMI, such as high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, family history, physical inactivity, and smoking.
